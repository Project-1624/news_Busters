“Dictionary” on President Obama’s Health Care Taxes
WASHINGTON – The Republican National Committee announced a new web video today on President Obama’s health care taxes.

“For months, President Obama has tried to convince the American people that his government-run health care experiment will be all gain and no pain, but they aren’t buying it. The fact is, his plan contains huge new taxes that will harm the economy and cost more jobs. Democrats are paying for their dangerous experiment with higher taxes on small business owners, charitable giving, and even middle-class families who can least afford it. I encourage President Obama to abandon these health care taxes and set a course for a truly bipartisan bill that embraces reforms Americans actually want and need.” – RNC Chairman Michael Steele
