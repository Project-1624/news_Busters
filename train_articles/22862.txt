Summary of the Latest Federal Income Tax Data, 2017 Update
See 2018 Update

The Internal Revenue Service has recently released new data on individual income taxes for tax year 2015, showing the number of taxpayers, adjusted gross income, and income tax shares by income percentiles.[1]

The data demonstrate that the U.S. individual income tax continues to be very progressive, borne primarily by the highest income earners.

In 2015, 141.2 million taxpayers reported earning $10.14 trillion in adjusted gross income and paid $1.45 trillion in individual income taxes.

The share of reported income earned by the top 1 percent of taxpayers rose slightly to 20.7 percent in 2015. Their share of federal individual income taxes fell slightly, to 39.0 percent.

In 2015, the top 50 percent of all taxpayers paid 97.2 percent of all individual income taxes while the bottom 50 percent paid the remaining 2.8 percent.

The top 1 percent paid a greater share of individual income taxes (39.0 percent) than the bottom 90 percent combined (29.4 percent).

The top 1 percent of taxpayers paid a 27.1 percent individual income tax rate, which is more than seven times higher than taxpayers in the bottom 50 percent (3.6 percent).

Reported Income and Taxes Paid Both Increased in 2015

Taxpayers reported $10.14 trillion in adjusted gross income (AGI) on 141.2 million tax returns in 2015. Total AGI grew $434 billion from 2014 levels, less than the $675 billion increase between 2013 to 2014. There were 1.6 million more tax returns filed in 2015 than in 2014, meaning that average AGI rose by $2,261 per return, or 3.3 percent.

Taxes paid rose to $1.45 trillion for all taxpayers in 2015, a 5.8 percent increase over the previous year. The average individual income tax rate for all taxpayers rose slightly, from 14.16 percent to 14.34 percent, and the average tax rate increased for all groups except the top 1 percent.

The most likely explanation behind the higher tax rates in 2015 is a phenomenon known as “real bracket creep.” [2] When incomes rises faster than inflation, more income is pushed into higher brackets and thus becomes subject to higher tax rates.

The share of income earned by the top 1 percent rose slightly to 20.65 percent of AGI, up from 20.58 percent in 2014, but the share of the income tax burden for the top 1 percent fell slightly, from 39.48 percent in 2014 to 39.04 percent in 2015. The reason for this slight decrease is that growth in itemized deductions claimed by this group of taxpayers outpaced growth in AGI for this group from 2014 to 2015. Particularly, taxpayers claimed significantly larger deductions for state and local taxes paid.[3] By claiming an increased amount of itemized deductions in 2015, the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid federal income taxes on a smaller share of their income, resulting in a slightly lower effective income tax rate than in 2014.

High-Income Americans Paid Majority of Federal Income Taxes

In 2015, the bottom 50 percent of taxpayers (those with AGI below $39,275) earned 11.28 percent of total AGI. This group of taxpayers paid approximately $41 billion in taxes, or 2.83 percent of all income taxes in 2015.

In contrast, the top 1 percent of all taxpayers (taxpayers with AGI of $480,930 and above), earned 20.65 percent of all AGI in 2015, but paid 39.04 percent of all federal income taxes.

In 2015, the top 1 percent of taxpayers accounted for more income taxes paid than the bottom 90 percent combined. The top 1 percent of taxpayers paid $568 billion, or 39.04 percent of all income taxes, while the bottom 90 percent paid $428 billion, or 29.41 percent of all income taxes.

High-Income Taxpayers Paid the Highest Average Income Tax Rates

The 2015 IRS data show that taxpayers with higher incomes pay much higher average income tax rates than lower-income taxpayers.[4]

The bottom 50 percent of taxpayers (taxpayers with AGIs below $39,275) faced an average income tax rate of 3.6 percent. As household income increases, the IRS data show that average income tax rates rise. For example, taxpayers with AGIs between the 10th and 5th percentiles ($138,031 and $195,778) paid an average effective rate of 14.0 percent – nearly four times the rate paid by those in the bottom 50 percent.

The top 1 percent of taxpayers (AGI of $480,930 and above) paid the highest effective income tax rate, at 27.1 percent, 7.5 times the rate faced by the bottom 50 percent of taxpayers.

Figure 2.

Taxpayers at the very top of the income distribution, the top 0.1 percent (with AGIs over $2.22 million), paid an even higher average income tax rate of 27.4 percent.

Appendix

For data prior to 2001, all tax returns that have a positive AGI are included, even those that do not have a positive income tax liability. For data from 2001 forward, returns with negative AGI are also included, but dependent returns are excluded. Income tax after credits (the measure of “income taxes paid” above) does not account for the refundable portion of EITC. If it were included, the tax share of the top income groups would be higher. The refundable portion is classified as a spending program by the Office of Management and Budget and therefore is not included by the IRS in these figures. The only tax analyzed here is the federal individual income tax, which is responsible for over 25 percent of the nation’s taxes paid (at all levels of government). Federal income taxes are much more progressive than federal payroll taxes, which are responsible for about 20 percent of all taxes paid (at all levels of government), and are more progressive than most state and local taxes. AGI is a fairly narrow income concept and does not include income items like government transfers (except for the portion of Social Security benefits that is taxed), the value of employer-provided health insurance, underreported or unreported income (most notably that of sole proprietors), income derived from municipal bond interest, net imputed rental income, and others. The unit of analysis here is that of the tax return. In the figures prior to 2001, some dependent returns are included. Under other units of analysis (like the U.S. Treasury Department’s Family Economic Unit), these returns would likely be paired with parents’ returns. These figures represent the legal incidence of the income tax. Most distributional tables (such as those from CBO, Tax Policy Center, Citizens for Tax Justice, the Treasury Department, and JCT) assume that the entire economic incidence of personal income taxes falls on the income earner.
