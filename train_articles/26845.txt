BREAKING: Roy Moore’s Accuser Arrested And Charged With Falsification
After it was discovered that Roy Moore’s accuser is a liar and a Democrat, Alabama Attorney General John Simmons filed charges of falsification, a 1st-degree misdemeanor. Mary Lynne Davies, who said Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14-years-old and he was in his early 30s, now faces a year in prison and $10K in fines.

The revelation came after the yearbook inscription that Moore supposedly wrote in the 1970s turned out to be a forgery. Davies, who tried desperately to convince anyone who would listen that Moore raped her, is now in hiding after posting $500 in bail money. Her attorney says she sticks by her story:

“My client’s main concern is that because of the yearbook thing, nobody will believe her story. She fabricated the yearbook because nobody would listen in the first place. She’s a victim and now she’ll be prosecuted while her abuser goes to the US Senate. Nothing about this is right. Nothing.”

Nothing about this is wrong, jerk. Justice Moore is a fine, upstanding man who has shown time and time again that he loves America and our family values. He deserves to be exonerated. The AG says he’s also looking into charges against the other Moore accusers as well as the employees of that mall that said he was a pedophile.

Moore’s attorney says there are no hard feelings and that his client will continue to fight for women’s rights.
