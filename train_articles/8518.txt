GOP Official Who Says America Needs ?Another 9/11? Shares _______________ With Trump
The resistance against Trump must continue…these aren’t just small ideological differences being played out, or debates where both sides should be calmly and distantly considered. To the contrary, the very foundation and basis of the country we call our own is at stake! That is why this viral guide to getting involved with the opposition is so important…if you haven’t read it yet, you should absolutely do so now!

And things continue to look dire, and it goes even beyond Trump: GOP Rep Rob McCaskill (R-Texas) Twitter feed, much like the Orange one in the Oval Office, is a huge basket full of crazy. He tweets with glee about global warming “hoaxes.” He tweets that Americans should boycott Nordstrom for removing Ivanka’s merchandise (they were, that’s why they pulled the line).

The worst tweet from McCaskill, though, was one from Friday, where he very literally wished for another 9/11 just to prove judges wrong. That’s right, he tweeted “Can’t wait for the next 9/11 so the 9th District circuit ruling judges will wish they didn’t roll over for enemies wishing death on America #MuslimBan.”

Um, seem scary to you? With tweets saying the judges would be responsible for a terrorist attack, the administration is laying the groundwork for a deeper police state or for something we’ve never had in this country, martial law. Trump is a dictator. While McCaskill may not be smart enough to be in on the plan, he’s certainly complicit and he’s demonstrating what nearly all Republicans are guilty of. He doesn’t care about the American people. He only cares about his party.

This is terrifying, and there’s never been a more important time to stand up to fight and defend your country. If you are ready to join the opposition but aren’t quite sure how to get involved, take this grassroots call to action today!
