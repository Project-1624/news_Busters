More Czars Than the Romanovs
Meet Obama's Czars

With the Obama Administration's latest creation of a new czar position - the pay czar, announced Wednesday - TPM decided to take a look at just how many have been named so far.



When he announced his 9th czar, Obama already had more than any other President. We gave him a break and didn't include the special envoys - like George Mitchell to the Middle East - considered czars by some. Despite that, there are still upwards of 20 (and more to come, for cyber security and intellectual property). John McCain's words ring true: Obama has more czars than the Romanovs.

Drug Czar

Czar R. Gil Kerlikowske



What it means:



The former police chief of Seattle, Kerlikowske was sworn in as the the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy on May 7. According to the official website, he "coordinates all aspects of Federal drug control programs and implementation of the President's National Drug Control Strategy."

Energy Czar

Czar Carol Browner



What it means:



Officially the Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change, this is what Obama said at the press conference announcing her nomination: "Carol understands that our efforts to create jobs, achieve energy security and combat climate change demand integration among different agencies, cooperation between federal, state and local governments and partnership with the private sector."

Auto Recovery Czar

Czar Ed Montgomery



What it means:



Montgomery is the director of recovery for auto communities and workers - he's spent time in Detroit at workshops "on applying for federal grants and other financial assistance." The title can possibly be shared with Steve Rattner, who the NYT calls the "car czar lite" - "one of 14 people on a committee that is orchestrating the rescue of the giant automakers."

What it means:



As head of the new White House Office of Urban Affairs, this former Bronx Borough President is in charge of the planning and execution of all urban affairs policy and programs.

Chopra works with Kundra and Chief Performance Officer (or Performance Czar) Jeffrey Zients, not pictured.
