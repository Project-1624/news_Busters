Kushner And Wife Ivanka Trump Were Tossed Out Of The White House — And Donald Is Cutting Them Out Of His Will!
It’s been a rough day for Trump’s extended family as White House adviser Jared Kushner‘s has officially had his security clearance downgraded from Top Secret to the Secret level, a major sign of disrespect to the young adviser.

Kushner, who is President Trump’s son-in-law, will no longer be able to access top-secret intelligence, Politico confirmed, noting three sources close to the situation.

Sources explained to the publication that a memo was released last week to Kushner and other White House aides informing them that their security clearances would be downgraded from the Top Secret/SCI level to the Secret level.

According to Politico, the memo he was sent was not personally signed by chief of staff John Kelly.

White House chief of staff John Kelly is reportedly furious with first daughter Ivanka Trump‘s job performance within the administration, according to a recent report by CNN.

Sources revealed to the news network that Kelly thinks that Trump has failed to have an objective perspective on the first daughter and senior adviser to the president.

Kelly has reportedly explained to others privately that the first daughter is “playing government,” while branding her child tax credit as “a pet project.”

The shocking report comes after Trump’s trip to the closing Olympic ceremonies in Pyeongchang, South Korea last week, which has raised concerns among several in the White House, including Kelly.

“This isn’t like going to Italy. The stakes are far higher and more complex,” a source close to President Trump explained to CNN.

Kelly reportedly expressed his worries behind closed doors about the first daughter’s utter lack of experience, however, the White House assured this past Monday that he was in support of her visit.
