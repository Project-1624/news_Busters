The Supreme Court Database
Analysis Specifications - Modern Data (1946-2017) If you are interested in a single case, you can access information about it (along with links to the decision) by entering the US, S.Ct. L.Ed. or Lexis citation. You can also enter the case name, docket number, Database ID, or Search Code by using the blank box to the right of this text.



If you want to analyze all the cases or a subset of them, first, select the set of cases by using the the form on this page. By default, your selection will be by the individual citation. In other words, if, for example, the Court has consolidated two cases (each with a different docket number) under the same "U.S." citation, by default only the first (lead) case will be used in any analyses; if you want both cases, click on "Dockets" in the Data Grouping area below. You also can select cases by legal provision and by whether there was a split vote—those in which two vote coalitions emerged on a single issue or legal provision. For more information, on how to select sets of cases, please consult the documentation to the Database. Once you've selected a set of cases, the Analysis Results page provides a variety of summary data about the selected cases. Each search is assigned a unique identifier so that you easily repeat or refer to it.
