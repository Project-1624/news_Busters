Speaker Paul D. Ryan condemned on Tuesday the proposal by Donald J. Trump that Muslims be barred from entering the country, saying it is “not what this party stands for.”

Offering a markedly stern reproach for Mr. Trump, who leads most polls of the Republican presidential field, Mr. Ryan said he had opposed including religion requirements in a recent bill to tighten refugee admittance restrictions because freedom of religion is “a founding principle of this country.”

“This is not conservatism,” he said at the House Republican leadership’s weekly news conference. “What was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for and, more importantly, it’s not what this country stands for.”

Mr. Ryan has made it a policy not to comment on the presidential race, making his comments on Mr. Trump — “an exception,” as he prefaced it Tuesday — all the more striking. He said that in addition to having Muslim members of the armed forces and in Congress, there were many Muslims fighting terrorism alongside the United States.

“Some of our best and biggest allies in this struggle and fight against radical Islamic terror are Muslims, the vast, vast, vast majority of whom are people who believe in pluralism, freedom, democracy, individual rights,” he said.
