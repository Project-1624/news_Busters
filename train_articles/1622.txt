Autism and Vaccines
Beyond the Autism/Vaccine Hypothesis: What Parents Need to Know about Autism Research

A decade ago most researchers agreed that we needed to study vaccines in relation to autism. We had to reconcile the fact that the number of vaccines children were receiving was increasing, and at the same time, the number of children who were being diagnosed with autism also was on the rise. Fortunately this was a question that could be studied – and answered – by science. We looked at children who received vaccines and those who didn’t, or who received them on a different, slower schedule. There was no difference in their neurological outcomes. Multiple studies have been completed which investigated the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination in relation to autism. Researchers have also studied thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative, to see if it had any relation to autism. The results of studies are very clear; the data show no relationship between vaccines and autism. Read the studies themselves below and browse our recommended reading list.

A Journalist’s Guide to Covering Outbreaks of Vaccine-Preventable Disease

From the producers of the PBS-NOVA special “Vaccines—Calling the Shots.”

On January 21st, 2011, Dr. Paul Offit was on The Colbert Report speaking about his new book, “Deadly Choices: How The Anti-Vaccine Movement Threatens Us All.” Click Here to Watch the Interview.

On September 9, 2014, ASF President Alison Singer was on The Leonard Lopate Show to talk about the risks of not vaccinating. Click here to listen to the program.

What’s Next?

If we ask the same questions we’ll get the same answers. We’ve asked the autism vaccine question over two dozen times and each time we get the same response: no relationship. We need to move on. We need to invest in studying genetics, the brain structures of children with autism, and environmental factors that may be playing a role.

Below are three fact-sheets prepared by physicians at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. They are excellent resources to distribute at events.

Below are two tables prepared by the initiative Every Child By Two. These tables summarize the major procedures and conclusions of the most recent studies regarding autism and Thimerosal, as well as autism and the MMR vaccine.
