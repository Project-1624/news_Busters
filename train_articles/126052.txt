FACT CHECK: Sarah Palin: Vaccinations May Cause Homosexuality
Claim: Sarah Palin said vaccinations were linked to homosexuality.

FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, February 2015]



Did Sarah Palin, while on the Glenn Beck program, say that vaccinations caused homosexuality?



Origins: On 5 February 2015, an image of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin was posted to the Facebook page “Stop The World, the Teabaggers Want Off,” along with a quote purportedly uttered by her during an appearance on the Glenn Beck Program on 28 January 2015:





There’s a connection between vaccinations and homosexuality. Anybody with eyes can see that. It doesn’t take a doctor to figure that out.





But the former Alaska governor said no such thing. The “Stop the World” Facebook group is a satirical one that frequently attributes fictitious quotes to conservative politicians. On 1 January 2014, the group claimed Palin made offensive comments about “white privilege,” and on 13 January 2015, the group attributed a dubious diatribe questioning Michelle Obama’s feminine qualities to Mitt Romney.

The group’s disclaimer page notes its material is satirical and intended for “entertainment purposes” only:
