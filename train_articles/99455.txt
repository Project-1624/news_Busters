Hoaxed: The ‘Illegal Alien Mom with Barefoot Kids’ Photo was a Setup – Another Staged #FakeNews Production

Guest post by Joe Hoft

Yesterday’s Headline is today’s hoax. The illegal alien mother ‘fleeing’ from the border wall was all a lie. It was a setup.

After further review, yesterday’s ‘horrific’ picture of a woman with barefoot children running from the US border wall was a hoax. In the background of the picture a group of men are posing for one camera man and another is running towards another camera man. In other areas, people are just standing around. The woman with the children was just a photo-op:

#FakeNews Media all share same photo of “women & kids gassed”. Perpetrators of invasion instantly become victims in new #FakeNews narrative. Congratulations, you’ve been #Hoaxed! 😀✊🏿✊🏽✊ pic.twitter.com/ISkExrlc2T — 🇺🇸#WalkAway Mexican J.Lo. (@jetrotter) November 26, 2018

The high resolution picture shows guys in the background posing for a cameraman proving again that liberals are easily fooled:

Look at the high resolution picture of the guys in the back holding each other for the photographer to make it look like they are running. They know how naive & foolish the liberal/Progressive/normal viewer brainwash gang is. https://t.co/cgOkTkdoZF — An0maly (@LegendaryEnergy) November 26, 2018
