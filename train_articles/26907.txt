Actress Emma Stone: ‘For The First Time In History We Have A President That…’
Hollywood star Emma Stone shared her opinion recently about the political situation in the US and commented President Trump’s controversial actions.

Emma Stone stated that she is usually not “involved in politics”, but current political events do have an effect on her which is why she felt the need to say her opinion about them.

She stated: “I simply want what’s best for our nation. I admit that at first I wanted Hillary to win, but with time I understood that America made a great choice with Donald Trump.”

“I understand that people don’t like him – I really do. At first I didn’t either, but he became our President so what we need to do is stand behind him in times like this.”

Hatred is the last thing we need nowadays, we must unite. I feel that Donald Trump is doing everything he can to improve our nation, you might just want to respect him and stay patient.”

Emma Stone also stated that there is nothing wrong if you give someone a chance. ”I don’t know. I think that people need to stay patient for a while and see what happens. People are too nervous these days. There is no need for that.” “Let’s give him a chance. So far he’s doing ok and I really believe that for the first time in history we have a President that can change this country for the better.” What do you think about this?
