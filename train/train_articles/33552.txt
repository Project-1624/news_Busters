Marijuana Tax Data
The marijuana tax reports show tax revenue collected monthly as posted in the Colorado state accounting system.

For more information, please see the Marijuana Taxes | File page.

The table below shows medical and retail marijuana tax and fee collections totals by calendar year starting in 2014. Although sales of medical marijuana began prior to 2014, the Department of Revenue did not report tax collection data until February of 2014, after retail marijuana sales began.

The Marijuana Tax Data Reports on this page are not the same as the Marijuana Sales Reports. The Marijuana Sales Reports show unaudited monthly sales as self-reported by businesses on State sales returns and do not use Metrc® data (the Marijuana Enforcement Division's Marijuana Inventory Tracking System). The Marijuana Tax Data reports show tax revenue collected monthly as posted in the State's accounting system.

Appropriations and expenditures of marijuana tax collections can be found on the Disposition of Marijuana Tax Revenue webpage.

DID YOU KNOW? Colorado's Marijuana Enforcement Division released the 2017 Colorado Marijuana Market Size and Demand Study, which provides an updated view and assessment of Colorado’s marijuana market and improves upon the original 2014 market study methods.
